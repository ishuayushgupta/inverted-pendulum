# inverted-pendulum
Decribes how a pendulum is stabilised in its unstable equilibrium position.  

THIS PROJECT IS A PART OF CONTROL SYSTEM WHICH INVOLVES TECHNIQUE TO STABILISE A SYSTEM BY APPLYING AN APPROPIATE CONTROL.

IT INVOLVES SHIFTING THE POLES OF CHARACTERTIC EQUATION OF SYSTEM TO LEFT HALF OF S-PLANE.

inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over. It is stabilised by using PID ALGORITHM BY MOVING ITS PIVOT POINT BY APPROPIATE DIRECTION AND SPEED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
PID STANDS FOR PROPORTIONAL INTEGRAL AND DERIVATIVE.

COMPONENTS USED =>> 2 ENCODERS[ TO FIND THE NET PENDULUM ANGLE DISPLACED FROM ITS STABLE POSITION  AND TO FIND THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY PIVOT POINT FROM ITS REFERENCE POSITION]
